Lists all flight combinations for a selected route between airports A -> B

This is a task created by Kiwi as an entrence task for python weekend 
Assignment here: https://github.com/kiwicom/python-weekend-xmas-task

## Solution 
To solve this essential task - find all routes from A to B - I used Dijkstra's algorithm 

Using priority queue (heapqueue) I use airport name as a route point and calculated price as it's value. 

All possible routes are listed, ordered from lowest total price to highest.
